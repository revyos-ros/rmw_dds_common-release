The package `rmw_dds_common` claims to be in the **Quality Level 4** category.

Below are the rationales, notes, and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Requirements for Quality Level 4 in REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

## Version Policy [1]

### Version Scheme [1.i]

`rmw_dds_common` uses `semver` according to the recommendation for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#versioning).

### Version Stability [1.ii]

### Public API Declaration [1.iii]

All symbols in the installed headers and message files (.msg) are considered part of the public API.

All installed headers are in the `include` directory of the package, headers in any other folders are not installed and considered private.
All installed message files are in the `msg` directory of the package.

### API Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.iv]/[1.vi]

`rmw_dds_common` will not break public API within a released ROS distribution, i.e. no major releases once the ROS distribution is released.

### ABI Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.v]/[1.vi]

`rmw_dds_common` contains C and C++ code and therefore must be concerned with ABI stability, and will maintain ABI stability within a ROS distribution.

## Change Control Process [2]

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has at least one copyright statement.

The results of the test can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rmw_dds_common/).

## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

Each feature in `rmw_dds_common` has corresponding tests which simulate typical usage, and they are located in the `test` directory.
New features are required to have tests before being added.

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

Each part of the public API have tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added.
The tests aim to cover both typical usage and corner cases, but are quantified by contributing to code coverage.

### Coverage [4.iii]

Results of the nightly linter tests can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rmw_dds_common/).

## Dependencies [5]

### Direct Runtime ROS Dependencies [5.i]/[5.ii]

`rmw_dds_common` has the following runtime ROS dependencies:
* `rcutils`
* `rcpputils`
* `rmw`
* `rosidl_default_runtime`
* `rosidl_runtime_cpp`

It has several "buildtool" dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they do not contribute to the public library API.
It also has several test dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they are only used to build and run the test code.

### Direct Runtime Non-ROS Dependencies [5.iii]

`rmw_dds_common` does not have any runtime non-ROS dependencies.

## Platform Support [6]

`rmw_dds_common` supports all of the tier 1 platforms as described in [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers), and tests each change against all of them.

Currently nightly results can be seen here:
* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/rmw_dds_common/)
